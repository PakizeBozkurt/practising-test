# This is my practising about TDD repo.

### TDD Principles:


Best Practices for Test Driven Development (TDD) Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It follows a cyclical process of writing a failing test, writing the minimum code to make the test pass, and then refactoring the code.

-If a unit test fails, you should write product code only to pass the unit test.

-You should not write more unit tests.

-You should not write more production codes as compared to what is required for passing a single failing unit test.
