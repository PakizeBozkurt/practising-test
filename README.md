# This is my practising about TDD repo.

### TDD Principles:

-If a unit test fails, you should write product code only to pass the unit test.

-You should not write more unit tests.

-You should not write more production codes as compared to what is required for passing a single failing unit test.

## Feel free to contribute, feature and bug reports.

### Happy testing!
